### Recommender Systems

* Introduction
* Content-based Recommendation Systems
* Collaborative Filtering
    - User-based Neighbourhood Model
    - Item-based Neighbourhood Model
    - Matrix Factorization
* Recommendation as Classification

---

# Recommender Systems

* We make a lot of **decisions** every day
    - Transportation
    - Restaurant reservation
    - Hotel reservation
    - Music
    - Movies
* We usually rely on some **suggestions** or **recommendations**
    - Family and friends
    - Supervisors, teachers, seniors
    - Experts
    - The general public (word-of-mouth)

---

# Recommender Systems

### What are the factors that affect our decisions?

* Our own **preferences** (of the content, the characteristics, the price, etc.)
* What do **most people like**? (which is the blockbuster movie recently?)
* What do **people around us like**? (friends and family)
* What do people **similar to us** like?

# Recommender Systems

* There are **many** items out there for us to choose
    - Tens of thousands of movies and songs
    - More than 1 million apps in the Android and iPhone app stores
    - Millions of books published every year
* We need more efficient way to **filter information**, and identify items **most relevant** to us
* On the other hand, producers also want to **provide consumers things that they really want** (targetted marketing)

# Solution: Recommender Systems

* Use **computers** and **algorithms** to process the huge amount of inforamtion and do the **filtering** for us
* Analyse the **tastes** and **preferences** of different people
* Analyse the **characteristics** of different items/products
* Generate **personalized** recommendation based on users' **past activities** and **feedback**
* Systems performing the above tasks are referred to as **recommender systems** / **recommendation systems**

* **Item Similarity**
    - Recommend **items that are similar** to what the user has already shown interest
* **User Similarity**
    - Recommend items that are preferred by **users who are similar the the target user** in some ways
* **Diversity**
    - Recommend items that are **least known** to the uuser

# Content-based Recommendation

# Content-based Recommendation

* **Assumptions**
    - Every user has his/her own **interests** / **tastes** / **preferences**
    - Each user's preferences can be represented as **a summary of what he/she has seen/read/watched/liked in the past**
    - A user will prefer something he or she is interested in
* We can compare the **content** or **characteristics** of the items
* Recommend items that are **similar** to what the user has consumed before

---

# Content-based Recommendation

### Two Steps

1. Learn user **preferences** (what does the user like?)
2. Find items that **match** these preferences

### Problems

1. How do we **learn** user preferences?
2. How do we **represent** user interests?
3. How do we **represent** items?
4. How to measure **similarity**?

---

# Content-based Recommendation

### **Similarity-based**

* **Steps**
    - Define features to represent the items (e.g. bag-of-words, author, publish date/time, etc.)
    - Construct **user profile** by the items liked by the user (e.g. average of feature vectors)
    - Calculate **similarity** between user profile and the new items
    - Return a **ranked list** of items
* What is important here is the **user profile**
    - How can we **represent** a user?
    - A user may have **multiple interests**, or his/her interests may **change over time**

---

# Content-based Recommendation

### Limitations of Content-based Methods

* Content (including meta-data) might not be available or enough in some domains
* It is difficult to represent some items by their 'content' (e.g. movies, books, music)
* Content-based methods tend to return very similar items

# Collaborative Filtering

# Collaborative Filtering

### What is Collaborative Filtering (CF)?

* From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering):<br/><br/>*In the newer, narrower sense, collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.*

---

# Collaborative Filtering

### Basic Idea

* Instead of relying on the content of the items, we can analyse people’s **tastes and preferences**
* Each person is NOT totally different from another
* There are different **kinds** of people, for example:
    - People who like action movies
    - People who read literature
    - People who like spicy food
* By grouping **similar users**, we can recommend similar items to similar users
* This does not require a lot of information about the users and items themselves

---

# Collaborative Filtering

### Two Types of Collaborative Filtering

1. **Memory-based**
    - Directly use ratings from similar users or items
    - Also called **neighbourhood-based** methods
2. **Model-based**
    - Mathematical models are used to represent users, items and their relations
    - E.g. **matrix factorization**, Bayesian networks, probabilistic models

---

# Collaborative Filtering

### User-item Interaction

* In the following discussion, we assume that a user may **rate** an item on a **1 to 5** scale

</center>

# Memory-based Collaborative Filtering

---

# Neighbourhood

### What is neighbourhood?

* Consider again the **vector space model**
* Users and items can be represented as **vectors** in a high dimensional space
* More similar items/users will appear **closer** to each other

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-neighbourhood.png" width="60%"/>
</center>

---

# Neighbourhood Models

### Two Types of Neighbourhood Models

1. **User-based**
    - We consider **similar users**
    - The neighbourhood of a user consists of users who like similar items
2. **Item-based**
    - We consider **similar items**
    - The neighbourhood of an item consists of items that are preferred by similar users

---

# User-based Collaborative Filtering

* **Task**: Predict the **extent** to which user `\(u\)` likes item `\(i\)`
* **Procedures**:
    - We have user `\(u\)`, and item `\(i\)`
    - Find a set of users who are similar to `\(u\)` and have rated `\(i\)`
    - Get the **average rating** on `\(i\)` given by this set of users
    - Do this for all items, come up with a **ranking** based on the predict rating

---

# User-based Collaborative Filtering

* In doing **user-based CF**, we made the following **assumptions**:
    - If users had similar tastes in the past, they should have similar tastes in the future
    - User preferences remain **stable and consistent** over time
* Furthermore, we need to define **similarity**
* **Similarity**
    - Should reflect how **close** the tastes and preferences of two users are
    - Similar users should assign **similar ratings** to the same set of items

---

# Similarity - Pearson Correlation

* One way of computing similarity between two users is to use the **pearson correlation**

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-pearson-correlation.png" width="70%"/>
</center>

---

# Similarity - Pearson Correlation

* `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`: users
* `\(r_{x,i}\)`: rating assigned to `\(i\)` by `\(x\)`
* `\(I\)`: the set of items rated by both `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`
* `\(\text{sim}(x, y)\)` has a value between -1 and 1

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-pearson-correlation-equation.png" width="60%"/>
</center>

---

# Similarity - Pearson Correlation

* In Python, you can easily compute the correlation using the
`scipy` module's [pearsonr function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html)

```python
>>> from scipy.stats import pearsonr
>>> a = [5,2,1,4,3,1]
>>> b = [1,5,4,2,1,2]
>>> pearsonr(a,b)
(-0.59628479399994383, 0.21157899460007421)
>>>
>>> a = [5,2,1,4,3,1]
>>> b = [4,3,1,5,4,2]
>>> pearsonr(a,b)
(0.85978530414910515, 0.028111919656069226)
>>>
```

# Predicting Ratings

* How to **predict** a user's rating for an item?
* Use the equation below:<br/><br/>

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-user-based-prediction.png" width="80%"/>
</center>

* Example: see [l5-user-based-cf.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KgSz_razs9UwFfpL0hg9K3_Fh_JqTre_)

---

# Limitations

* **Data sparsity**
    - When there are a lot of users and items, very
few overlap between users
* **Does not scale**
    - When there are 10 million users, how can
you generate all their neighbourhoods?
* Two users may have similar taste in one domain but very
different taste in another

---

# Item-based Collaborative Filtering

### Procedures

* We have user `\(u\)` and item `\(i\)`
* Find a set of **items**, which are
    - rated by `\(u\)`
    - given **similar ratings** as  `\(i\)` by other users
* Get the **average rating** of this set of items given by `\(u\)`
* Use that as the predicted rating of `\(i\)` by `\(u\)`

---

# Item-based Collaborative Filtering

* In doing **item-based CF**, we made the following **assumptions**:
    - If two items are given similar ratings by the users, they should have **similar characteristics**
* Consider **movies**:
    - Movies of the same genre, by the same director, or feature the same actor/actress will be assigned similar ratings
* Ref: [Amazon.com Recommendations: Item-to-Item Collaborative Filtering](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=642471)

---

# Predicting Ratings

* One way to implement item-based CF is to compute a **weighted combination of ratings** given by `\(u\)` to other items

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-item-based-prediction.png" width="70%"/>
</center>

---

# Neighbourhood-based Collaborative Filtering

* Neighbourhood and recommended items are usually calculated **offline** 
* In order to reduce the amount of computation needed, the size of the neighbourhood is usually **limited**
* Previous research shows that a neighbourhood size of **20-50** is quite enough
* Ref: [Empirical Analysis of Design Choices in Neighborhood-based Collaborative Filtering Algorithms](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=594047), Herlocker et al., 2002.

# Model-based Collaborative Filtering

---

# Model-based Collaborative Filtering

* What we have discussed so far are called **memory-based** collaborative filtering
* We have not **trained** any model that can be used to describe the relationship between inputs and outputs
* Memory-based models are **easy to implement**, but usually are NOT very accurate and NOT **scalable**
* Instead, we can consider a **machine learning approach** to the task of recommendation:
    - Create a model that explains how **ratings are generated**, or how **items are ranked**
    - Use past data to **train/optimize** the parameters of the model

---

# Model-based Collaborative Filtering

### We can roughly categorize model-based CF into two types:
* **Matrix Factorization Approach**
    - Assume that there are **latent factors** that determine how users rate items
    - Decompose the user-item matrix using matrix factorization techniques
* **Classification Approach**
    - Consider the task of recommendation as a **classification** problem
    - For each given pair of user and item, we determine whether the user will be interested in the item (binary classification)
    - Can take into account **contextual information** and **implicit feedbacks**

# Gradient Descent

---

# Parameter Optimization

* Training machine learning models usually means **optimizing parameters** in the model using the **training data**
* Each model is characterized by a set of **parameters**
* Consider linear regression as an example:

$$y = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ... + b_n x_n$$

* Each `\(b_i\)` is a parameter of the model
* How exactly do we find the most suitable values of these parameters given the training data?

---

# Parameter Optimization

* In some cases, we can find a solution **analytically**
    - The solution can be represented by a equation
    - The best parameters can be obtained by substituting the training data `\(X\)` and `\(y\)` into the equation
* However, in many cases, the model is complicated and we cannot do that analytically
* Another approach: **trial and error**
    1. **Initialize** the paraemeters randomly
    2. Use the model to **generate predictions** for the training data
    3. Computer the **error** of the predictions
    4. Use the error to **adjust** the parameters
    5. Go to Step 1 if model is not good enough

# Gradient Descent

.column-left[
* Let's consider a very simple example
* We want to learn a linear model `\(y = mx\)`
* Our training data:
    - `X = (1, 2, 3, 4)`
    - `y = (2.4, 3.5, 5.5, 8.7)`
* Obviously the value of `\(m\)` can be determined analytically
* Let's try our **gradient descent** on this example

    <img src="img/l5-gd-example.png" width="90%"/>
</center>
]

---

# Gradient Descent

* To perform gradient descent, we need to first have an **error function** that allows us to understand how much error we are making using current values of the parameters (also called **objective function** or **loss function**)
* Our error function:

$$
error = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - m x_i)^2
$$

* where N is number of training samples
* (note that we use the **mean squared error** in this case)

---

class: split

# Gradient Descent

.column-left[
* The objective is to **adjust** the value of our parameter `\(m\)` such that next time the error will be **smaller**
* By **adjusting** we mean either **increase** or **decrease** its value
* To know to which direction we should adjust `\(m\)`, we need to know the **gradient** of the error
* In our case:

$$
\frac{\partial e}{\partial m} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (-2 x_i y_i + 2 m x_i^2)
$$

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-error-plot.png" width="90%"/>
</center>
]

---

class: split

# Gradient Descent

* Once we know the gradient, we know how to adjust `\(m\)`
* If gradient is **positive**, we need to **reduce** `\(m\)`
* If gradient is **negative**, we need to **increase** `\(m\)`
* We use a **hyperparameter** called the **learning rate** to determine **how much** do we adjust `\(m\)` each time
    - If we change the value too much, we may **miss** the optimal value
    - If we cahnge the value too little, we may never arrive at the optimal value
* Implementation in Python: [l5-gradient-descent-example.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GY9jFS_iwuD-BSnr_sOmdZ7T6SbrVhGE)

# Matrix Factorization

---

# Model-based Collaborative Filtering

* Recall that in recommender systems, we usually deal with a matrix of **user-item ratings**
* In **memory-based methods**, we directly compute a prediction based on the other ratings
* In **model-based methods**, we come up with a **model** of how ratings are **generated**
* **Matrix factorization** is a commonly used model-based methods in recommendations

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-user-item-matrix.png" width="50%"/>
</center>

---

# Matrix Factorization - Basic Idea

* We assume that users and items can be grouped into different **types**
* Take **movies** as an example:
    - Some users like action movies, while some like romantic movies
    - Some movies are romantic, while some are exciting and full of suspense

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-user-item-types.png" width="70%"/>
</center>

---

# Matrix Factorization

### Challenge

* How can we discover **types** of users and items from our data?
* **Clustering**?

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-user-item-types-2.png" width="80%"/>
</center>

---

# Matrix Factorization

* Clustering users and items separately **does NOT** work well
    - We need to **manually inspect** the meaning of each group
(cluster)
    - We do not know which user groups correspond to which
item groups
    - There is no guarantee that we will obtain exact
**correspondence** between user groups and item groups
    - E.g. there might be a group of users who like animations,
but animations might be grouped under different clusters
according to their content

---

# Matrix Factorization

* We can approach this problem differently
* Let's assume in advance that there are **`\(K\)` different types of users and items**
* We use **vectors of length `\(K\)`** to represent users and items
* Each component (**factor**) in a vector represents the **extent** to which the user/item **belongs to that type**<br/><br/>

$$
\text{user}_1 = (0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 1.2, 2.3) \\\
\text{user}_2 = (3.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4)
$$

$$
\text{item}_1 = (0.2, 0.9, 1.5, 0.2, 0.8) \\\
\text{item}_2 = (1.5, 2.3, 0.0, 0.9, 0.0)
$$

---

# Matrix Factorization

* If we consider all the **users** and **items** in our recommender system, we can represent all of them using two different **matrices**

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-user-item-matrices.png" width="80%"/>
</center>

---

# Matrix Factorization

* In such a model, the rating on item `\(i\)` given by user `\(u\)` is generated by computing the **dot product** of the corresponding user and item **vectors**
* This is equivalent to multiplying the (transpose of) the item matrix with the user matrix

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-matrix-factorization.png" width="80%"/>
</center>

---

# Matrix Factorization

* Usually, we are given the matrix `\(R\)`, **matrix factorization** is the process of finding `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)` such that `\(P x Q^T\)` gives an approximation of `\(R\)`

$$
P \times Q^T = \hat{R} \approx R
$$

* Very often `\(R\)` is **incomplete** (e.g. 99% of the cells are empty),
* Therefore, we have to estimate the values in `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)`, instead of solving for exact values
• The number of factors `\(K\)` reflects the complexity of our
model

---

class: split

# Matrix Factorization

.column-left[
* In matrix factorization, our target is to come up with `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)`, the two **factor matrices** whose product approximates the user-item rating matrix `\(R\)`
* When we say approximate, we are talking about the **known
values** in `\(R\)`
* If we can approximate the known values well, our **predictions** of the unknown values will be **accurate**

$$
\hat{r}\_{ui} = \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki}
$$

# Matrix Factorization

* Our goal is to find all `\(p_{ik}\)` and `\(q_{kj}\)` such that

$$
\sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki} \approx r\_{ui}
$$

* Our data only contain the values of **some** `\(r_{ij}\)`
* How can we determine the values of all `\(p_{ik}\)` and `\(q_{kj}\)`?

---

# Matrix Factorization

### Basic Idea:

* We first initialize `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)` with some **random values**
* We measure our **error**, i.e. how far we are from the **true** values in R
* We update the values in `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)` based on the error we computed
* **Repeat** the steps above until the error is sufficiently small<br/><br/>
* In other words, we can use **gradient descent**

<center>
    <img src="img/l5-matrix-factorization-example.png" width="70%"/>
</center>

* The **dot product** of the user vector and the item vector is:

$$
0.5 \times 1 + 1 \times 0 + 1.5 \times 2 = 3.5
$$

* We can then compute our **error**

# Matrix Factorization

* Error is give by:

$$
e\_{ui} = r\_{ui} - \hat{r}\_{ui} = r\_{ui} - \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki}
$$

* Squared error:

$$
e\_{ui}^2 = (r\_{ui} - \hat{r}\_{ui})^2 = (r\_{ui} - \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki})^2
$$

* The **machine learning** problem here is to optimize all `\(p\)`'s and `\(q\)`'s such that `\(e_{ui}^2\)` is **minimized**

### Gradient Descent

$$
e\_{ui}^2 = (r\_{ui} - \hat{r}\_{ui})^2 = (r\_{ui} - \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki})^2
$$

$$
\frac{\partial e\_{ui}^2}{\partial p\_{uk}} = -2 (r\_{ui} - \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki}) q\_{ki} = -2 e\_{ui} q\_{ki}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial e\_{ui}^2}{\partial q\_{ki}} = -2 (r\_{ui} - \sum\_{k=1}^K p\_{uk} q\_{ki}) p\_{uk} = -2 e\_{ui} p\_{uk}
$$

---

# Matrix Factorization

* Having obtained the gradients, we can construct our **update rules** as follows:

<br/>
$$
p'\_{uk} = p\_{uk} - \alpha (-2 e\_{ui} q\_{ki}) = p\_{uk} + 2 \alpha e\_{ui} q\_{ki}
$$
<br/>

$$
q'\_{ki} = q\_{ki} - \alpha (-2 e\_{ui} p\_{uk}) = q\_{ki} + 2 \alpha e\_{ui} p\_{uk}
$$
<br/>

* where `\(\alpha\)` is the **learning rate**
* `\(p'_{uk}\)` and `\(q'_{ki}\)` are the **new values**

### Training Data

* Note that we only optimize `\(P\)` and `\(Q\)` using the **known values** in the matrix `\(R\)`
* We can consider transforming the user-item rating matrix into a list of **tuples**:<br/>(user, item, rating):

# Beyond Rating Predictions

* In many other cases, we do NOT always have **ratings (explicit feedback)** from the users
* Instead, we would have **implicit feedback** from the users on the items
    - The user purchased an item
    - The user clicked on an advertisement
    - The user viewed the details of an item
* Implicit feedbacks can also be considered as **(weaker) indications** that the user is interested in the items
* We can still populate a user-item matrix using implicit feedbacks

# Recommendation as Classification

* Besides rating prediction using matrix factorization, recommendation can also be considered as a **classification task**
* Ultimately, we want to determine the **probability that a user is interested / likes / wants to purchase an item**
* Besides the explicit/implicit feedbacks, there are actually a lot of things we can consider as **features**
    - date/time when the users visit the Website
    - the browsing history of the users
    - the various characteristics of the items (e.g. actors/actresses in a movie, storyline of a fiction)
    - Whether the user is using a PC or a smartphone
    - **interactions** between user and item features

---

# Recommendation as Classification

* Recommendation can be considered as a **binary classification** problem
    - Whether the user will **click** on an advertisement
    - Whether the user will **purchase** the item
    - Whether the user will **download** the mobile app
* **Common classification models** can be used
    - Logistic regression
    - Support vector machines
    - Decision trees / Random forests
* The most important things in this approach are the **features** --> **Feature Engineering**

# Recommendation as Classification

* To train a classifier, you need both **positive** and **negative** samples
* However, very often you don't know what the user **DOES NOT** like
* A user hasn't interacted with an item DOES NOT mean that he/she is not interested in an item
* **Negative sampling**
    - For each positive feedback you have, **randomly sample** items that the user has not interacted with
    - Use these items as **negative** samples
    - Can also weight each sample differently (how?)
