  <h2 id="image-classification-and-telegram-bot">Image Classification and Telegram Bot</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deadline</strong>: 30th November, 2019 (Friday)</li>
  <li><strong>Total Marks</strong>: 100</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To try using existing deep learning frameworks to classify images using pre-trained models</li>
  <li>To get familiar with socket programming in Python</li>
  <li>To get familiar with message passing between threads and processes in Python</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<p>In this assignment, you will build an <strong>image classifier</strong> and then deploy the classifier as a <strong>chatbot</strong> on <strong>Telegram</strong>. You will NOT be required to train your own model, as the focus would be on socket programming and multi-threaded programming in Python.</p>

<p>You will build a system which offer image classification service via Telegram bot. A user in Telegram can either send <strong>an image</strong> or <strong>the URL of an image</strong> to the bot, and the bot will feed the image (download the image first if it is given a URL) into a deep learning model to generate image classification predictions, and then send back the result to the user.</p>

<p><img src="/assignments/assignment2-system.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The overall architecture of the system is shown in the diagram above. The details of each component will be described below.</p>

<h2 id="the-bot-script">The Bot Script</h2>

<p>In the Bot Script (<code>bot.py</code>), you should implement logic that performs the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Continuously receiving user messages from Telegram</li>
  <li>Whenever a message is received, <strong>if</strong> the message contains an <strong>image</strong>, or <strong>if</strong> the message’s text has an URL inside, get the binary data of the image, and send it via a <strong>TCP connection</strong> to the server</li>
  <li>If the message does not contain an image or a URL to an image, <strong>nothing</strong> has to be done</li>
  <li>Once classification results are received from the server, <strong>format</strong> the output and send the results back to the user</li>
</ul>

<p>Your script should have at least <strong>three threads</strong> running. Each thread will be responsible for different operations. The threads <strong>should NOT share any variables</strong>, and data between different threads should be passed using <strong>queues</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="thread-1---receiving-messages">Thread 1 - Receiving Messages</h3>

<p>You can re-use part of the scripts you wrote in Assignment 1 to listen for messages the user sends via Telegram. You can assume that the message can be of one of the following <strong>two types</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The message contains only <strong>text</strong>, which is a <strong>URL</strong> to an image on the Web</li>
  <li>The message contains a <strong>photo</strong> (refers to Telegram’s <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#message">API documentation</a> to see how to retrieve the photo from Telegram)</li>
</ol>

<p>In this thread, you should keep getting messages from Telegram. Once a message is received, you should extract the image (either from the given URL or from Telegram), and pass the <strong>image object</strong> as well as the <strong>chat_id</strong> to <strong>Thread 2</strong> by putting it into <strong>Queue 1</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Hint 1</strong>:</p>

<p>You can use the following code to download the photo from Telegram.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">if content_type == 'photo':
    bot.download_file(msg['photo'][-1]['file_id'], 'file.png')
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Hint 2</strong>:</p>

<p>You can load an image from a file using the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/">Pillow</a> package:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from PIL import Image

image = Image.open('file.png')
</code></pre>

<h3 id="thread-2---client-thread">Thread 2 - Client Thread</h3>

<p>This thread keeps getting data from <strong>Queue 1</strong>. Once data is obtained form the queue, it should create a socket and attempt to establish <strong>a new TCP connection</strong> to the server.</p>

<p>Once the connection is established, it should <strong>send the image as well as the chat_id</strong> to the server, and then wait for the response from the server. Since the data sent to the server should be a <strong>string</strong>, you should first create a <strong>dictionary</strong> containing the data, and then use <code>json.dumps</code> to convert it into a JSON-encoded string.</p>

<p>You will need to implement your own method for determining whether a message is <strong>fully received</strong> on both the client side and the server side. For example, you can append a special string such as <code>##END##</code> at the end of the message to delimit the message.</p>

<p>Note that you should have received <strong>an image object</strong> from <strong>Queue 1</strong>. You should <strong>encode the binary data</strong> into string such that it can be sent over the TCP connection. One way of doing this is to convert the image object into a <strong>base64 encoded</strong> string:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import base64
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open('file.png')
buffered = BytesIO()
image.save(buffered, format="PNG")
encoded_image = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue())
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the dictionary that will be encoded using <code>json.dumps</code> would be something like the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">data = {
    'image': &lt;base64-encoded string of the image object&gt;,
    'chat_id': &lt;chat id as received from Telegram&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When the response from the server is received, this thread should put the response into <strong>Queue 2</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="thread-3---sending-messages">Thread 3 - Sending Messages</h3>

<p>This thread keeps getting data from <strong>Queue 2</strong>. Once data is received, it should format the output and send a message back to the user via Telegram.</p>

<p>The message sent to the user should contain the <strong>top 5 classes</strong> predicted by the model in the server. As an example, if a photo of a container ship is received from the user, the message sent to the user should look like below:</p>

<pre><code>1. container_ship (0.4625)
2. lifeboat (0.1579)
3. wreck (0.1383)
4. pop_bottle (0.0477)
5. dock (0.0406)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-server">The Server</h2>

<p>In the <code>server.py</code> script, you will need to implement a <strong>TCP server</strong>, in which there are <strong>two threads</strong> running (including the main thread). The <strong>main thread</strong> will be responsible for <strong>listening for incoming connections</strong> from clients. Once a client is connected, it should pass throught a queue the client socket to the <strong>second thread</strong>, which will communicate with the client.</p>

<p>The second thread should pre-load a <strong>PyTorch pre-trained Inception V3 model</strong> when it is first started. It will then continuously getting data from the queue. Given a client socket, it will read the message from the client, first <strong>decode the JSON data</strong>, and then <strong>decode the base64-encoded image data</strong>. It should then feed the image into the neural network, and obtain the predicted classes as well as the probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Hint 1</strong>: The base64-encoded image can be decoded using the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import base64
image_data = base64.b64decode(encoded_image)
with open('image.png', 'wb') as outfile:
    outfile.write(image_data)
</code></pre>

<p>Once the predictions are generated, the second thread should compose a dictionary containing the <strong>top 5</strong> predictions, as well as the <strong>chat_id</strong> in the original message as in the example below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">{
    "predictions": [
        {"label": "container_ship", "proba": 0.4625},
        {"label": "lifeboat", "proba": 0.1579},
        {"label": "wreck", "proba": 0.1383},
        {"label": "pop_bottle", "proba": 0.0477},
        {"label": "dock", "proba": 0.0406},
    ],
    "chat_id": &lt;chat_id&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This dictionary should be JSON-encoded, and then sent back to the client.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>

<p>You should prepare <strong>two files</strong> to be submitted for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>bot.py</strong>: the script in which you implement the Telegram bot</li>
  <li><strong>server.py</strong>: the script in which you implement the server deploying the image classification model</li>
</ul>

<p>You should put these two files in a folder named <student_id>_assignment1 (e.g. 12345678_assignment2), and compress it into a zip file (e.g. 12345678_assignment2.zip). Submit the compressed file to Blackboard.</student_id></p>
