.column-left[
* A computer program generates an input given and output, given some **pre-defined function(s)**
* ML aims at **learning** a function that maps the inputs to the outputs
* Instead of having a programmer writing down the **logic**, we let the computer **learn** from the data
* Given historical data, we train a **model** to generate predictions on **future or unseen** inputs

# Machine Learning

* Given some input `\(X\)` and ouptut `\(y\)`, find a function `\(F(X)\)` that maps `\(X\)` to `\(y\)`.
* Example: given (<span style="color:#CC4455">location, size</span>) (`\(X\)`), predict the <span style="color:#CC4455">price</span> of a house (`\(y\)`).
* Another example: give (<span style="color:#CC4455">previously watched movies</span>) (`\(X\)`), predict the <span style="color:#CC4455">next movie(s) that will be watched</span> (`\(y\)`).

# Common ML Systems Workflow

* There are several common **workflows** for machine learning systems
    1. Train offline ➤ Predict offline ➤ Store predictions in DB
    2. Train offline ➤ Embed model in a device ➤ Predict online
    3. Train offline ➤ Make model available as a service ➤ Predict online
* Notes:
    - **Offline**<br/>separate from a production system; does not have to be completed in real time
    - **Online**<br/>part of a production system; perform tasks in real time

---

# Common ML Systems Workflow (1)

* Train offline ➤ Predict offline ➤ Store predictions in DB
* Example: **Recommender systems**
    - A model is trained **offline**
    - For each user, generate (pre-compute) a list of recommended items, store in **database**
    - When the user visits the Website, return the list of items

# Common ML Systems Workflow (2)

.column-left[
* Train offline ➤ Embed model in a device ➤ Predict online
* Example: **Object detection using a drone**
    - A model is trained offline
    - The model together with other processing logic are downloaded to the drone's computer
    - The drone detects objects while it is in operation

# Common ML Systems Workflow (3)

* Train offline ➤ Make model available as a service ➤ Predict online
* Example: **Spam E-mail detection**
    - A classifier is trained offline with spam and non-span emails
    - Deployed as a service to serve users or other components in the system

    <img src="img/l1-ml-service-example.png" width="85%"/>
</center>

---

# Common ML Systems Workflow

* In (2) and (3), we need to think about how to **deploy** a machine learning model
* Definition of **deploy**:
    - To place some resources into a position so as to be ready to for action or use
* In this course, we will focus on **Use Case (3)**
    - How to make machine learning models **available** to other users/systems?
    - How to serve machine learning models over the **network**
    - How to deploy our models to serve **many** concurrent users?

---

# Challenges in Deploying Machine Learning Models

- Requirement of **computing resources** (RAM, CPU/GPU)
- **Time** required to generate a prediction
- How to **update** the model
- How to serve many **concurrent requests**
- How to **monitor** model performance
- ...

# Computer Network

* A network that allows computers to perform data communication with one another

<center>
<img src="img/l1-computer-network.png" width="45%">
</center>

* The Internet is **a network of networks**. ([Global Internet Traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_traffic#Global_Internet_traffic))

---

# Data Communication

* Exchange of data between two devices using some form of transmission medium
* A simplified communication model:

<center>
<img src="img/l1-data-communication.png" width="80%">
</center>

* When performing communication, we need **protocols**: rules that govern how data is transmitted in this system

---

# Protocols

* **Network protocols** defines how computers talk to each other, including:
    * How to start a communication
    * The format of a message
    * What should be done when the data is corrupted during transmission
    * What should be done when the connection is broken during transmission
    * ...
* Examples: **TCP/IP**, **HTTP**, **FTP**
* Internet protocols are specified in documents called [**Requests for Comment (RFC)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments), such as:
    * [RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793)
    * [RFC 1180 - A TCP/IP Tutorial](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1180)
    * [RFC 6455 - The WebSocket Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)

# Problems and Challenges in Computer Networking

### Challenges in Networking:

* How can data be transmitted from one node to another through the network?<br/> **(e.g. routing/switching)**
* How can we address the computers?<br/>  **(e.g. IP Address)**
* How can we identify which applications on the computers the data should be delivered to? <br/> **(port and socket)**
* How to handle error or missing data?<br/>  **(e.g. the TCP protocol)**
* What if a large amount of data is transmitted at the same time?
* How to **coordinate** a large number of applications over a network?

### The Dining Philosophers Problem

* Details: [Dining philosophers problem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem)
* Five philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
* Each philosopher must alternately think and eat.
* A philosopher can only eat when he has both left and right forks.
* Each fork can be held by only one philosopher.
* A proper solution should never arrive in a **deadlock** situation.

# Challenges in Network and Concurrent Programming

### The CAP Theorem

* Details: [CAP theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)
* In a distributed system, three properties are of particular interests:
    * C – Consistency
    * A – Availability
    * P – Partition Tolerance
* Recommended Reading: Kaushik Sathupadi. ‘A plain english introduction to CAP Theorem’ [http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/](http://ksat.me/a-plain-english-introduction-to-cap-theorem/)

---

# The CAP Theorem

* **C: (Atomic) Consistency**
    * A ‘read’ to the system will always reflect the latest ‘write’ action
    * All node sees the same data at the same time
* **A: Availability**
    * Every request received by a non-failing node must result in a response (the system is continuously available to the clients)
    * It does not guarantee that the response is given in a specific period of time, however there should be a response for ever request
* **P: Partition Tolerance**
    * A distributed system has multiple nodes, partition tolerance requires that the system continues to operate even when the network fails

---

class: split

# The CAP Theorem

.column-left[
* Also known as Brewer’s Theorem
* It states that it is **impossible** for a distributed system to have **all 3 properties** at the same time.
* Reference: Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch, “Brewer's conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services”, ACM SIGACT News, Volume 33 Issue 2 (2002), pg. 51-59.

</center>
]

---

# The CAP Theorem

### Choosing between consistency and availability:

* **C + P**
    * When network is partitioned, partitioned nodes will not be able to return a response
    * Clients receive timeout or error
    * Preferred when **strict atom consistency is needed** (e.g. e-commerce site)
* **A + P**
    * A partitioned node will return the most recent version of the data it has, not guaranteed to be the same as the latest version
    * Opt for this if **availability** is important, and there is flexibility in returning the latest data to the clients

# Programming in Python

* Hello World in Python

```python
$ python3
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 23 2017, 16:37:01) 
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> 
```

* Type `python3` (or simply `python`) to invoke the Python interpreter
* `print()` will output the arguments to standard output

---

# Programming in Python

* Python programs (or scripts) are commonly named using the `.py` extension, and are called **modules**
* A "hello world" script `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hellow World!")
```

* Executing the script:

```bash
$ python3 hello.py 
Hello World!
$
```

---

# What do people use Python for?

### Python is a general purpose programming language and are widely used in different domains. (See [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/))

* Web and Internet applications backend (e.g. Youtube, Dropbox, Reddit)
* Scientific computing
* Data science and machine learning (e.g. Tensorflow, Keras)
* Data visualization
* Financial Analysis
* ...

---

# Installing Python

* Available on Linux / Mac / Windows (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Note: Download **Python 3.6** for this course
* IDEs recommended for Python programming:
    1. [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (Community Edition is free)
    2. [MS Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Free and open source)

* Python comes with some standard modules, other modules can be installed using `pip` (https://pypi.python.org/pypi). For example:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install requests
```

---

# Python Basics

```python
# Everything after a `#` is comment
# import modules using the import keyword
import math

# define functions using def
def power_three(x):
    return math.pow(x, 3)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(power_three(10))

# Executing this script prints 1000.0
```

* In Python, **indentation** is important: the statements in the same logical block should have the **same** indentation.
* Set your editor to use SPACES instead of TAB for indentation.
* You **do not** have to declare a variable before using it

    print("Less than Zero")

# while loop
x = 0
while x < 10:
    x += 1

# for loop
for x in range(10):
    print(x)

# Python Data Structures

### Lists

* Lists are like arrays in other languages, but are more flexible

```python
cities = ["Hong Kong", "Macau", "Taipei", "Beijing"]
print(cities[0])     # prints "Hong Kong"
print(cities[2])     # prints "Taipei"

print(cities[-1])    # prints "Beijing"

print(len(cities))   # prints 4

print(cities[1:3])   # prints ["Macau", "Taipei"]
print(cities[:3])    # prints ["Hong Kong", "Macau", "Taipei"]
print(cities[2:])    # prints ["Taipei", "Beijing"]
print(cities[::-1])  # prints ["Beijing", "Taipei", "Macau", "Hong Kong"]
```

---

# Python Data Structures

### Using lists in for loops

* Lists are iterables, meaning that you can loop through each of its values as follows:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sum = 0
for n in numbers:
    sum += n

print(sum)  # prints 55
```

---

# Python Data Structures

### List methods

* List objects have a number of using methods:

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]

x.append(4)           # x becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
x.insert(0, 0)        # x becomes [0, 1, 2, 3]
x.extend([4, 5])      # x becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x.sort(reverse=True)  # x becomes [3, 2, 1]
x.index(2)            # this returns 1, the index of the element 2
```

* For a comprehensive list of methods, see https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

# Python Data Structures

### Dictionaries

* Another commonly used data structure in Python is the **dictionary**
* It can be used to store **key-value pairs** (Similar to the "associative arrays" in PHP)
* Keys must be immutable types (e.g. Lists cannot be used as keys)

```python
exam_scores = {"John": 70, "Mary": 80}

print(exam_scores["John"])   # prints 70
print(exam_scores["Mary"])   # prints 80

print(list(exam_scores.keys()))    # prints ["John", "Mary"]
print(list(exam_scores.values()))  # prints [70, 80]
```

---

# Python Data Structures

* **Iterating over key-value pairs in a dictionary**
* Given that a dictionary is used to store key-value pairs, you can iterate over all key-value pairs using a loop as follows:

```python
exam_scores = {"John": 70, "Mary": 80}

# exam_scores.items() actually returns [("John", 70), ("Mary", 80)]
# which is a list of 2-tuples
for name, score in exam_scores.items():
    print("{:s} scores {:d} in the exam.".format(name, score))
```

* In the above `print` statement, `{:s}` is a string placeholder, `{:d}` is an integer placeholder.
* More can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html

# Files in Python

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r")   # open a file in read mode
for line in f:
    print(line)

f.close()  # Always close the file after use
```

* In practice, it is better to specify the encoding of the file content

```python
f = open("file.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
for line in f:
    print(line)

f.close()
```

---

# Python Modules

* A **module** in Python is a file containing Python definitions and statements
* Put your source codes in different modules to avoid having a huge single `.py` file
* You can **import** class, functions and variables from other modules

```python
# This is in my_functions.py
def factorial(n):
    f = 1
    for i in range(n):
        f *= i + 1
    return f

# In another file, e.g. main.py
from my_functions import factorial
print(factorial(5))  # prints 120
```

### Coding Convention and Styles

* Python's development is based on the [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/), which is a list of proposals of new features
* [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) describes coding conventions or style guides for Python programming.

# Using Virtualenv

### Dependencies

* When working on a Python project, it is common that you will use modules outside of the standard library (e.g. requests, BeautifulSoup, numpy, pandas)
* Different projects may have different dependencies (on **different modules**, or even **different versions** of the modules)

### Project isolation

* [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a software that allows you to create an isolated environment for a project
* Install virtualenv by:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

---

# Using Virtualenv

* Once installed, you can create a virtual environment using the following command (`venv` is the name of the environment, which you can choose as you like):

```bash
$ virtualenv venv
```

* To activate the environemnt, use the following command:

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $
```

* Once you see the `(venv)` prefix, it means that the virtual environment is successfully activated.
* From this point onwards, all `pip install` command will only install packages **within this environment**
* To exit the environment, type **`deactivate`**
